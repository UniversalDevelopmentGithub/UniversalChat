## Why Universal Chat?

Universal Chat isn't just a translation pluginâ€”it's a comprehensive toolset for enhancing multiplayer interactions. Whether you're aiming to foster global camaraderie or maintain localized communication, Universal Chat provides the flexibility and reliability needed to elevate your Minecraft server's chat experience.

## How Does It Work?

Universal Chat sends chat messages to our custom translation API, swiftly converting them into the correct language before returning them. As messages become more frequently used, they are cached instead of re-translating, ensuring even faster translations over time.

**Universal Chat: Connecting players, transcending languages.**

## Available Commands

`/lang set <language>` - Set a language for messages to be translated into. (No permission needed)

**Example:** `/lang set nl`

(This will set the player's language to Dutch, and all player chat messages will be translated to that language for that player!)
